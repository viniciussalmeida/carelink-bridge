# carelink-bridge

Sends your Medtronic pump and CGM data to [Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info/) automatically.

It connects to Medtronic's CareLink servers the same way the official CareLink app does, grabs your latest pump and sensor data, and uploads it to your Nightscout site on a regular interval.

## What you need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 18 or newer (download and install it if you don't have it)
- A [CareLink](https://carelink.minimed.com/) account with a connected pump (MiniMed 7xxG, MiniMed Connect, or Guardian Connect)
- A working [Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info/) site

## Getting started

### 1. Download and install

Download or clone this repository, then open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Configure

Make a copy of the file `.env.example` and name it `.env`. Open it in any text editor and fill in your details:

```env
CARELINK_USERNAME=your-carelink-username
CARELINK_PASSWORD=your-carelink-password
API_SECRET=your-nightscout-api-secret
NS=https://your-nightscout-site.example.com
```

- **CARELINK_USERNAME / PASSWORD** — the same email and password you use to log in to CareLink
- **API_SECRET** — your Nightscout API secret (the same one you set up when you created your Nightscout site)
- **NS** — the full URL of your Nightscout site, starting with `https://`

If you're in the US, also add this line:

```env
MMCONNECT_SERVER=US
```

(The default is EU.)

### 3. Log in

Run:

```
npm run login
```

This will try to log in automatically. If CareLink asks for a CAPTCHA, a browser window will open — just log in like you normally would. Once you're in, the window closes by itself and your login is saved.

You only need to do this once. Your login tokens are saved in a file called `logindata.json`.

### 4. Start the bridge

```
npm start
```

That's it! The bridge will fetch your data every 5 minutes and upload it to Nightscout. Leave it running in the background.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No logindata.json found"** — Run `npm run login` first.
- **Login expired** — Delete the `logindata.json` file and run `npm run login` again.
- **Data not showing up in Nightscout** — Make sure your `NS` URL and `API_SECRET` are correct in the `.env` file.
- **US users seeing errors** — Make sure you have `MMCONNECT_SERVER=US` in your `.env` file.

## Settings

All settings go in the `.env` file. Only the first four are required — the rest are optional.

| `MMCONNECT_SERVER` | `EU` | Set to `US` if you're in the United States |
| `MMCONNECT_COUNTRYCODE` | `gb` | Your country code (e.g. `us`, `de`, `nl`) |
| `CARELINK_INTERVAL` | `300` | How often to fetch data, in seconds (300 = 5 minutes) |
| `CARELINK_PATIENT` | | Patient username, only needed if your care partner account has multiple patients |
| `CARELINK_ENABLE_TREATMENTS` | `true` | Upload CareLink marker-derived treatments to Nightscout |
| `CARELINK_ENABLE_AUTO_BASAL_TREATMENTS` | `true` | Include `AUTO_BASAL_DELIVERY` markers as Temp Basal treatments |
| `CARELINK_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS` | `false` | Upload CareLink notification history as Announcement treatments |
| `CARELINK_TREATMENTS_LIMIT` | `72` | Max number of treatments sent per poll cycle |
| `CARELINK_QUIET` | `true` | Set to `false` to see more detailed logs |
| `CARELINK_DEBUG_COMPARE_ENDPOINTS` | `false` | Compare carepartner payload richness across v6/v5/v11 endpoints and log selected endpoint |
| `CARELINK_DEBUG_MARKER_SAMPLES` | `false` | Log redacted sample `AUTO_BASAL_DELIVERY` marker payloads for field discovery |
